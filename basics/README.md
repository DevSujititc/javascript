## Basic Concepts

The `basics` directory covers fundamental JavaScript concepts, including:

- **Variables:** Learn about `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- **Functions:** Understand function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions.
- **Arrays:** Explore array methods and operations.
- **Objects:** Get to know object properties, methods, and the `this` keyword.

### Variables

Variables in JavaScript are used to store data values. You can think of variables as containers that hold information that you can access and manipulate later. JavaScript provides three keywords to declare variables: `var`, `let`, and `const`.

#### `var`

The `var` keyword is used to declare a variable. It has function scope, meaning it is accessible within the function it was declared in.

#### `let`

The `let` keyword is used to declare a block-scoped variable. It is only accessible within the block it was declared in.

#### `const`

The `const` keyword is used to declare a block-scoped variable with a constant value. This means the value cannot be reassigned.


##### Summary
- **var**: Function-scoped variable.
- **let**: Block-scoped variable.
- **const**: Block-scoped variable with a constant value.
